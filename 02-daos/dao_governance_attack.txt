a) Vulnerable DAOs and Attack Scenario
Vulnerable DAO characteristics:
DAOs that are most vulnerable to economic governance attacks usually have the following traits:
Low voter participation (e.g. <2% of total supply);
High governance token concentration (e.g. top 5 holders own >50%);
No or weak execution controls (e.g. no timelocks, no guardian veto);
On-chain execution enabled (proposal executes directly once passed).
These DAOs often emerge in bear markets, where activity drops and tokens lose value.

Attack strategy:
Accumulate or borrow governance tokens via secondary markets or lending protocols;
Create a malicious proposal, e.g., transferring treasury assets or granting minting rights;
Vote through the proposal using tokens owned or borrowed, exploiting low participation;
Execute the proposal to extract funds or change critical parameters.

Cost estimation:
Assume total token supply: 100M
Quorum requirement: 3M (3%)
Recent active votes: only ~1.5M
Attacker needs ~1.6M tokens to control vote
If token price = $1 → attack cost = $1.6M
If token is borrowable → attack cost = short-term interest/fees ($10–50K)

b) Potential Gains
If the proposal passes, the attacker can access:

1. Direct treasury funds:
Hypothetical DAO treasury:
2,000 ETH (~$6M)
1.5M USDC (~$1.5M)
Native governance token (illiquid, potential for manipulation)

Attacker could transfer funds or issue “grants” to controlled wallets.
Total gain: ≥ $7.5M

2. Long-term protocol control:
Instead of stealing funds, attacker can:
Change emission schedules or mint rate
Grant themselves admin control over the protocol
Remove governance safeguards (e.g. increase quorum, remove veto)
These allow long-term extraction of value via fees, token inflation, or bribes.
